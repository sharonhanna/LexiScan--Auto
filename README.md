📄 LexiScan-Auto — Intelligent Legal Document Processing System

LexiScan-Auto is an end-to-end Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system designed to extract structured legal information from scanned or digital contract PDFs using OCR + NLP + custom-trained Legal NER models, exposed through a FastAPI service and deployable via Docker.

🚀 Key Features

📑 PDF Ingestion (Scanned & Digital Contracts)

🔍 OCR-based Text Extraction using Tesseract

🧠 Custom Legal Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Trained on the CUAD (Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset)

📊 Structured JSON Output

Parties

Dates

Monetary Amounts

⚡ FastAPI-based REST API

🐳 Fully Dockerized for Deployment

## Model Evaluation (F1-Score)

The Legal NER model was evaluated using a validation sample.
Performance metrics include Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

- Precision: ~0.78
- Recall: ~0.75
- F1-score: ~0.76

F1-score is used as the primary metric due to entity class imbalance
and the importance of balanced extraction accuracy in legal documents.
